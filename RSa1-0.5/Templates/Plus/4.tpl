<p class="f10 b">How do I get Gold?</p>
<p>We offer several different tariffs at which you can buy gold. The only way to buy Gold is at <a href="plus.php">Travian PLUS</a>. Every other way can lead to legal measures and the deletion of the account. </p>

<p class="f10 b">Can I transfer my (remaining) Gold?</p>
<p>You can only transfer gold if you have purchased gold at least once (Free startup- and earned Gold is not transferable). After deleting your account (this means once you can no longer access it), you'll receive an email with a transfer link. The link will be sent to the address given by you during sign-up. Please keep in mind that gold is only transferable between servers of the same country / extension (same domain e.g. ".com", ".net", ".br", ".us", ".co.uk"). We are unable to assist you with transferring gold to different regions / extensions.</p>

<p class="f10 b">New procedure to transfer Gold:</p>
<p>When the desired recipient is chosen, they will get an IGM containing the option to accept the transfer. If the IGM is deleted before completing the transfer, the transfer link becomes invalid.</p>

<p class="f10 b">What happens to my Gold at the end of a game world?</p>
<p>All players on a game world which finished get an e-mail as well as an IGM containing a link. Using this link the remaining Gold can be transferred to another game world. Please keep in mind that gold is only transferable between game worlds of the same country / extension i.e. between all game worlds of the same top level domain, e.g. ".com", ".net", ".br", ".us", ".co.uk".</p>

<p class="f10 b">Does the transfer link expire?</p>

<p>The link has no expiration date.</p>

<p class="f10 b">Why does my payment get rejected/declined?</p>
<p>There are four different possibilities why the payment is declined/rejected:
<ul><li>when there has been a chargeback for your account and/or credit card in the past, you can’t use this payment option any longer.</li>
<li>you only have three trials to enter the right data.</li>
<li>you can only make one payment within 48 hours.</li>
<li>some cards are not accepted by the credit card company, so please try one of the other offered options.</li></ul>

<p class="f10 b">Why can't I finish some buildings with Gold?</p>

<p>Due to game play reasons the buildings Residence and Palace are excluded from this function. The same applies to villages in which the wonders of the world can be constructed. </p>

<p class="f10 b">I activated the Plus account, however, my resource production did not increase.</p>
<p>The production did not increase because Plus is separated from these additional features. </p>

<p class="f10 b">Do I need to activate Plus before I can use any other function?</p>
<p>No, you can use every single Gold feature as long as you have enough gold. </p>

<p class="f10 b">Can one buy Gold as Sitter</p>
<p>Yes, buying gold as sitter is possible. However, you can only use it with the NPC-Merchant. The Gold-Button in the Plus Menu is greyed out and cannot be selected.</p>

<p class="f10 b">What does "active orders" mean?</p>
<p>You can see the button "active orders" in the Plus menu. This shows you all finished payments as well as payments which are still in progress.</p>

<p class="f10 b">Is there anyone I can talk to if I have questions or problems?</p>
<p>Just send an e-mail to <script language="JavaScript"><!--
var name = "plus";
var domain = "travian.com";
document.write("<a href=\"mailto:" + name + "@" + domain + "\"><span class=\"t\">");
document.write(name + "@" + domain + "</span></a>");
// --></script>. Normally, the e-mail will be answered within 24 hours. </p></div>
